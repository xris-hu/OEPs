==Abstract==
OEP-35 is a standard protocol for data Token exchange based on ontology DDXF. Any platform or institution that passes the audit can be an exchange.

==Motivation==
The current centralized exchange lacks transparency, and the circulation of tokens faces too many restrictions, transaction costs are high, and security is not guaranteed. This agreement is aimed at solving the current problem. Based on this agreement, market participants choose their own exchanges and exchange data tokens themselves to achieve more efficient data and token circulation.

==Architecture==
According to the protocol architecture， we divides the exchange platform into two component<code>Exchange</code> and <code> TokenProxy</code>

Exchange is responsible for combining Maker's and Taker's orders, and sending orders to TokenProxy to provide funciton such as fillorer, cancelorder,etc. 
Exchange can be integrated through centralization or smart contract.

The TokenProxy is to decouple complex order matching and Token settlement on the blockchain.
TokenProxy provides RegisterExchangeRemoveExchange, AddToken, RemoveToken for Exchange, and is responsible for the settlement of <code>OEP-4</code>, <code>OEP-5</code>, <code>OEP-8</code> and other types of tokens.
Users need Approve Token to TokenProxy contract to complete settlement.

===Method===
====name====
====FillOrder====
<source lang="python">
def FillOrder(order:Order)
</source>
Orders can be filled by calling the following methods on the Exchange contract.

====CancellingOrder====
<source lang="python">
def CancellingOrder(order:Order)
</source>
CancellingOrder cancels the specified order, if success, the order be delete in order list.

====ExecutingTransaction====
<source lang="python">
def ExecutingTransaction(order:Order, proxyId:bytes)
event ExecutingTransaction(order:order, proxyId:bytes)
</source>

ExecutingTransaction will invoke specific token proxy(<code>proxyId</code>) contract, if success, the taker and maker gets the corresponding token.

====RegisterTokenProxy====
<source lang="python">
def RegisterTokenProxy(proxyId:bytearray)
event RegisterTokenProxy(proxyId:bytearray)
</source>
<code>proxyId</code> is the TokenProxy contract hash，after register TokenProxy, call the <code>ExecutingTransaction</code> function, it will call the TokenProxy contract's <code>TokenTransferFrom</code> Function

==Token Proxy==
===Method===
====AddToken====
<source lang="python">
def AddToken(contractHash:bytearray)
event AddToken(contractHash:bytearray)
</source>
<code>contractHash</code>is the token hash, the tokens traded on the exchange must be registered through this function.

====RemoveToken====
<source lang="python">
def RemoveToken(contractHash:bytearray)
event RemoveToken(contractHash:bytearray)
</source>
Token is removed from the exchange, <code>contractHash</code>is the token hash.

====GetTokens====
<source lang="python">
def GetTokens()
</source>
Returns all token types supported by the exchange.

====RegisterExchange====
<source lang="python">
def RegisterExchange(exchangeId:bytearray)
event RegisterExchange(exchangeId:bytearray)
</source>
The exchange needs to register this function to complete the token settlement on the chain.

====RemoveExchange====
<source lang="python">
def RemoveExchange(exchangeId:bytearray)
event RemoveExchange(exchangeId:bytearray)
</source>
The Token Proxy owner invoke this function to remove unauthorized exchange.

====GetAuthorizedExchange====
<source lang="python">
def GetAuthorizedExchange()
</source>
Return all registered exchanges.

====Approve====
<source lang="python">
def approve(from:bytearray, to:bytearray, tokenHash: bytearray, value)
evnet Approve(from:bytearray, to:bytearray, tokenHash:bytearray, amount:int)
</source>
The approve allows <code>to</code> account to withdraw from <code>from</code> account multiple times, up to the value amount.If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with value.

====ApproveMulti====
<source lang="python">
def ApproveMulti(approveList:bytearray)
</source>
ApproveMulti can perform multiple approve operations at one time.

====Allowance====
<source lang="python">
def Allowance(owner: bytearray, spender: bytearray, tokenHash: bytearray)
</source>
Returns the amount which spender is still allowed to withdraw from owner

====TokenTransferFrom====
<source lang="python">
def TokenTransferFrom(order:Order)
evnet TokenTransferFrom(order:Order)
</source>
TokenTransferFrom will complete the token settlement operation between maker and taker according to the information of the order.

====TokenTransferFromMulti====
<source lang="python">
def TokenTransferFromMulti(transferList:bytearray)
</source>
TokenTransferFromMulti can perform multiple TokenTransferFrom operations at one time.
